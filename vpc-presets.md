# VPC landing zone configurations
{: #sap-powervs-automation-presets}

This solution is verified and supported only with the Power Virtual Server with VPC landing zone deployments that use preconfigured configurations (presets) for VPC landing zone. These presets must be selected or inserted when deploying the VPC landing zone either separately or as part of a new Power infrastructure with VPC landing zone deployment. For more informtion about supported presets and provisioned trusted zones, data flows, and endpoints, see [VPC landing zone configurations](/docs/powervs-vpc?topic=powervs-vpc-powervs-automation-presets).
